         The algorithm takes into account gaps and inaccuracies caused by rounding to integer coordinates
         in the original data.
         Imagine two rectangles one with a side ( 0,0 ) ( 2.0, 17.0 ) 
         and the other has a side ( 0,0 ) ( 1.0, 8.5 )
         If for some reason those coordinates where round to ( 0,0 ) ( 2, 17 ) ( 0,0 ) ( 1, 9 ),
         there will be clearly a gap or overlap that was not intended.
         Even without rounding this effect takes place since there is always a minimum significant bit
         also when using doubles.

         If the user used as minimum accuracy 0.001, you need to choose Marge > 0.001
         The boolean engine scales up the input data with GetDGrid() * GetGrid() and rounds the result to
         integer, So (assuming GRID = 100 DGRID = 1000)  a vertex of 123.001 in the user data will
         become 12300100 internal.
         At the end of the algorithm the internal vertexes are scaled down again with GetDGrid() * GetGrid(),
         so 12300103 becomes 123.00103 eventually.
         So indeed the minimum accuracy might increase, you are free to round again if needed.

      are left alone. An often used trick to present polygons with holes by linking to the outside
      boundary, is therefore also handled properly.
      The algoritm first does a boolean OR operation on the polygon, and seperates holes and
      outside contours.
      After this it creates a ring shapes on the above holes and outside contours.
      This ring shape is added or subtracted from the holes and outside contours.
      The result is the corrected polygon.

      will become smaller.
